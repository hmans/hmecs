## Basic Usage

Miniplex can be used in any JavaScript or TypeScript project, regardless of which extra frameworks you might be using. Before we talk about using Miniplex in React, let's start with the basics!

### Creating a World

Miniplex manages entities in **worlds**, which act as containers for entities as well as an API for interacting with them. You can have one big world in your project, or several smaller worlds handling separate concerns.

```ts
import { World } from "miniplex"

const world = new World()
```

### Typing your Entities (optional, but recommended!)

If you're using TypeScript, you can define a type that describes your entities and provide it to the `World` constructor to get full type support in all interactions with it:

```ts
import { World } from "miniplex"

type Entity = {
  position: { x: number; y: number; z: number }
  velocity?: { x: number; y: number; z: number }
  health?: number
  paused?: true
}

const world = new World<Entity>()
```

### Creating Entities

The main interactions with a Miniplex world are creating and destroying entities, and adding or removing components from these entities. Entities are just plain JavaScript objects that you pass into the world's `add` and `remove` functions, like here:

```ts
const entity = world.add({ position: { x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 } })
```

We've directly added a `position` component to the entity. If you're using TypeScript, the component values here will be type-checked against the type you provided to the `World` constructor.

> **Note** Adding the entity will make it known to the world and all relevant archetypes, but it will not change the entity object itself in any way. In Miniplex, entities can _live in multiple worlds at the same time_!

### Adding Components

The `World` instance provides `addComponent` and `removeComponent` functions for adding and removing components from entities. Let's add a `velocity` component to the entity. Note that we're passing the entity itself as the first argument:

```ts
world.addComponent(entity, "velocity", { x: 10, y: 0, z: 0 })
```

Now the entity has two components: `position` and `velocity`.

### Querying Entities

We're going to write some code that moves entities according to their velocity. You will typically implement this as something called a **system**, which, in Miniplex, are typically just normal functions that fetch the entities they are interested in, and then perform some operation on them.

Fetching only the entities that a system is interested in is the most important part in all this, and it is done through something called **archetypes** that can be thought of as something akin to database indices.

Since we're going to move entities, we're interested in entities that have both the `position` and `velocity` components, so let's create an archetype for that:

```ts
/* Get all entities with position and velocity */
const movingEntities = world.with("position", "velocity")
```

> **Note** There is also `without`, which will return all entities that do _not_ have the specified components:
>
> ```ts
> const active = world.without("paused")
> ```
>
> Queries can also be nested:
>
> ```ts
> const movingEntities = world.with("position", "velocity").without("paused")
> ```
>
> Please read the "Advanced Usage" chapter below for some important notes on these!

### Implementing Systems

Now we can implement a system that operates on these entities! Miniplex doesn't have an opinion on how you implement systems â€“ they can be as simple as a function. Here's a system that uses the `movingEntities` archetype we created in the previous step, iterates over all entities in it, and moves them according to their velocity:

```ts
function movementSystem() {
  for (const { position, velocity } of movingEntities) {
    position.x += velocity.x
    position.y += velocity.y
    position.z += velocity.z
  }
}
```

**Note:** Since entities are just plain JavaScript objects, they can easily be destructured into their components, like we're doing above.

### Destroying Entities

At some point we may want to remove an entity from the world (for example, an enemy spaceship that got destroyed by the player). We can do this through the world's `remove` function:

```ts
world.remove(entity)
```

This will immediately remove the entity from the Miniplex world and all associated archetypes.

> **Note** While this will remove the entity object from the world, it will not destroy or otherwise change the object itself. In fact, you can just add it right back into the world if you want to!
