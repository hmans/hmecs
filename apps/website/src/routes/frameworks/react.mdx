# Using Miniplex in React

## Introduction

Miniplex' React integration allows you to **render existing entities using JSX**, but also **create new entities**, or **extend** existing ones with new components.

## Setup

First, you'll need to create a set of React components that represent your Miniplex world. You can do this by using the `createReactAPI` function that is exported by the `miniplex/react` module:

```ts
import { World } from "miniplex"
import { createReactAPI } from "miniplex/react"

const world = new World()
const ECS = createReactAPI(world)
```

> **Note:** You might be wondering why we're going through the trouble of creating a set of components for the given world, instead of passing the world down via context. The reason is twofold:
>
> 1. When using TypeScript, these generated components will know the entity type of the world they represent, giving you proper autocomplete and type hints when using them.
>
> 2. Since you can have multiple separate worlds (both in your own project, but maybe also because some dependencies of your project use Miniplex), you would quickly run into problems if you were to use a single context for all of them. By creating a set of components for each world, you can use them independently of each other.
