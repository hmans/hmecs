## Overview

**Miniplex is an entity management system for games and similarly demanding applications.** Instead of creating separate buckets for different types of entities (eg. asteroids, enemies, pickups, the player, etc.), you throw all of them into a single store, describe their properties through components, and then write code that performs updates on entities of specific types.

If you're familiar with **Entity Component System** architecture, this will sound familiar to you -- and rightfully so, for Miniplex is, first and foremost, a very straight-forward ECS implementation!

If you're hearing about this approach for the first time, maybe it will sound a little counter-intuitive -- but once you dive into it, you will understand how it can help you decouple concerns and keep your codebase well-structured and maintainable. [This post](https://community.amethyst.rs/t/archetypal-vs-grouped-ecs-architectures-my-take/1344) has a nice summary:

> An ECS library can essentially thought of as an API for performing a loop over a homogeneous set of entities, filtering them by some condition, and pulling out a subset of the data associated with each entity. The goal of the library is to provide a usable API for this, and to do it as fast as possible.

For a more in-depth explanation, please also see Sander Mertens' wonderful [Entity Component System FAQ](https://github.com/SanderMertens/ecs-faq).

### Headline Features

- A very strong focus on **developer experience**. Miniplex aims to be the most convenient to use ECS implementation while still providing great performance.
- **[Tiny package size](https://bundlephobia.com/package/miniplex)** and **minimal dependencies**.
- React glue available through [miniplex-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/miniplex-react), maybe more in the future?
- Can power your entire project or just parts of it.
- Written in **TypeScript**, with full type checking for your entities.

### Differences from other ECS libraries

If you've used other Entity Component System libraries before, here's how Miniplex is different from some of them:

#### Entities are just normal JavaScript objects

Entities are just **plain JavaScript objects**, and components are just **properties on those objects**. Component data can be **anything** you need, from primitive values to entire class instances, or even [entire reactive stores](https://github.com/hmans/statery). Miniplex puts developer experience first, and the most important way it does this is by making its usage feel as natural as possible in a JavaScript environment.

Miniplex does not expect you to programmatically declare component types before using them; if you're using TypeScript, you can provide a type describing your entities and Miniplex will provide full edit- and compile-time type hints and safety.

#### Miniplex does not have a built-in notion of systems

Unlike the majority of ECS libraries, Miniplex does not have any built-in notion of systems, and does not perform any of its own scheduling. This is by design; your project will likely already have an opinion on how to schedule code execution, and instead of providing its own and potentially conflicting setup, Miniplex will neatly snuggle into the one you already have.

Systems are extremely straight-forward: just write simple functions that operate on the Miniplex world, and run them in whatever fashion fits best to your project (`setInterval`, `requestAnimationFrame`, `useFrame`, your custom ticker implementation, and so on.)

#### Archetypal Queries

Entity queries are performed through **archetypal queries**, with individual queries indexing and holding a subset of your world's entities that have (or don't have) a specific set of components, and/or match a specific predicate.

#### Focus on Object Identities over numerical IDs

Most interactions with Miniplex are using **object identity** to identify entities (instead of numerical IDs). Miniplex provides a lightweight mechanism to generate unique IDs for your entities, but it is entirely optional. In more complex projects that need stable entity IDs, the user is encouraged to implement their own ID generation and management.

## Installation

Add the `miniplex` package to your project using your favorite package manager:

```bash
npm add miniplex
yarn add miniplex
pnpm add miniplex
```

## Basic Usage

Miniplex can be used in any JavaScript or TypeScript project, regardless of which extra frameworks you might be using. This document focuses on how to use Miniplex without a framework, but please also check out the framework-specific documentation available:

- [miniplex-react](https://github.com/hmans/miniplex/tree/main/packages/react#readme)

### Creating a World

Miniplex manages entities in **worlds**, which act as containers for entities as well as an API for interacting with them. You can have one big world in your project, or several smaller worlds handling separate concerns.

```ts
import { World } from "miniplex"

const world = new World()
```

### Typing your Entities (optional, but recommended!)

If you're using TypeScript, you can define a type that describes your entities and provide it to the `World` constructor to get full type support in all interactions with it:

```ts
import { World } from "miniplex"

type Entity = {
  position: { x: number; y: number; z: number }
  velocity?: { x: number; y: number; z: number }
  health?: number
  paused?: true
}

const world = new World<Entity>()
```

### Creating Entities

The main interactions with a Miniplex world are creating and destroying entities, and adding or removing components from these entities. Entities are just plain JavaScript objects that you pass into the world's `add` and `remove` functions, like here:

```ts
const entity = world.add({ position: { x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 } })
```

We've directly added a `position` component to the entity. If you're using TypeScript, the component values here will be type-checked against the type you provided to the `World` constructor.

> **Note** Adding the entity will make it known to the world and all relevant queries, but it will not change the entity object itself in any way. In Miniplex, entities can _live in multiple worlds at the same time_!

### Adding Components

The `World` instance provides `addComponent` and `removeComponent` functions for adding and removing components from entities. Let's add a `velocity` component to the entity. Note that we're passing the entity itself as the first argument:

```ts
world.addComponent(entity, "velocity", { x: 10, y: 0, z: 0 })
```

Now the entity has two components: `position` and `velocity`.

### Querying Entities

We're going to write some code that moves entities according to their velocity. You will typically implement this as something called a **system**, which, in Miniplex, are typically just normal functions that fetch the entities they are interested in, and then perform some operation on them.

Fetching only the entities that a system is interested in is the most important part in all this, and it is done through something called **queries** that can be thought of as something akin to database indices.

Since we're going to move entities, we're interested in entities that have both the `position` and `velocity` components, so let's create a query for that:

```ts
/* Get all entities with position and velocity */
const movingEntities = world.with("position", "velocity")
```

> **Note** There is also `without`, which will return all entities that do _not_ have the specified components:
>
> ```ts
> const active = world.without("paused")
> ```
>
> Queries can also be nested:
>
> ```ts
> const movingEntities = world.with("position", "velocity").without("paused")
> ```

### Implementing Systems

Now we can implement a system that operates on these entities! Miniplex doesn't have an opinion on how you implement systems – they can be as simple as a function. Here's a system that uses the `movingEntities` query we created in the previous step, iterates over all entities in it, and moves them according to their velocity:

```ts
function movementSystem() {
  for (const { position, velocity } of movingEntities) {
    position.x += velocity.x
    position.y += velocity.y
    position.z += velocity.z
  }
}
```

**Note:** Since entities are just plain JavaScript objects, they can easily be destructured into their components, like we're doing above.

### Destroying Entities

At some point we may want to remove an entity from the world (for example, an enemy spaceship that got destroyed by the player). We can do this through the world's `remove` function:

```ts
world.remove(entity)
```

This will immediately remove the entity from the Miniplex world and all existing queries.

> **Note** While this will remove the entity object from the world, it will not destroy or otherwise change the object itself. In fact, you can just add it right back into the world if you want to!

## Best Practices

### Use `addComponent` and `removeComponent` for adding and removing components

Since entities are just normal objects, you might be tempted to just add new properties to (or delete properties from) them directly. **This is a bad idea** because it will skip the indexing step needed to make sure the entity is listed in the correct queries. Please always go through `addComponent` and `removeComponent`!

It is perfectly fine to mutate component _values_ directly, though.

```ts
/* ✅ This is fine: */
const entity = world.add({ position: { x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 } })
entity.position.x = 10

/* ⛔️ This is not: */
const entity = world.add({ position: { x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 } })
entity.velocity = { x: 10, y: 0, z: 0 }
```

### Iterate over queries using `for...of`

The world as well as all queries derived from it are _iterable_, meaning you can use them in `for...of` loops. This is the recommended way to iterate over entities in a query, as it is highly performant, and iterates over the entities _in reverse order_, which allows you to safely remove entities from within the loop.

```ts
const withHealth = world.with("health")

/* ✅ Recommended: */
for (const entity of withHealth) {
  if (entity.health <= 0) {
    world.remove(entity)
  }
}

/* ⛔️ Avoid: */
for (const entity of withHealth.entities) {
  if (entity.health <= 0) {
    world.remove(entity)
  }
}

/* ⛔️ Especially avoid: */
withHealth.entities.forEach((entity) => {
  if (entity.health <= 0) {
    world.remove(entity)
  }
})
```

### Reuse queries where possible

The functions creating and returning queries (`with`, `without`, `where`) aim to be idempotent and will reuse existing queries for the same set of query attributes. Checking if a query for a specific set of query attributes already exists is a comparatively heavyweight function, though, and you are advised to, wherever possible, reuse previously created queries.

```ts
/* ✅ Recommended: */
const movingEntities = world.with("position", "velocity")

function movementSystem() {
  for (const { position, velocity } of movingEntities) {
    position.x += velocity.x
    position.y += velocity.y
    position.z += velocity.z
  }
}

/* ⛔️ Avoid: */
function movementSystem(world) {
  /* This will work, but now the world needs to check if a query for "position" and "velocity" already exists every time this function is called, which is pure overhead. */
  for (const { position, velocity } of world.with("position", "velocity")) {
    position.x += velocity.x
    position.y += velocity.y
    position.z += velocity.z
  }
}
```
